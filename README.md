## Release 🚀

See the release reference at https://volto-light-theme.readthedocs.io/reference/release.html.


## Trying Volto Light Theme with Docker 📦

This setup includes:

- **Prebuilt Docker images** for Backend and Frontend 🖼️
- **A complete stack** with a Traefik router and a Postgres database 🗃️
- **Accessible at** [http://voltolighttheme.localhost](http://voltolighttheme.localhost) 🌐

To start the Docker-based environment, without cloning this repository, follow these steps:

### Download docker-compose.yml

On your computer, create a new folder and download the current `docker-compose.yml`:

```sh
mkdir try-vlt
cd try-vlt
curl -L -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitconcept/volto-light-theme/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
```

Then start the stack using:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Once the backend image is running, create a Plone site with:

```sh
docker compose exec backend './docker-entrypoint.sh create-site'
```

🚀 Your Plone site is now up and running locally!
