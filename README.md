## Vision

The main vision of the Volto Light Theme (VLT) is to serve as a foundation for kitconcept's future projects, following the release of Plone 6.
It incorporates feedback from the company's clients and Plone community from the last few years of projects and the success stories in the UI/UX side.
It aims to be future-proof, keeping it aligned with the upcoming Volto and Plone 7 vision in terms of theming strategy decided by the Plone community.

## Upgrade Guide

See a detailed upgrade guide at https://volto-light-theme.readthedocs.io/latest/upgrade-guide.html.

## Developing 🏁

### Prerequisites ✅

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **UV** 🐍 (Python dependency manager)
- **Node.js 22** 🟩
- **pnpm** 🧶 (JavaScript package manager)
- **Docker** 🐳 (Containerized environment)

### Installation 🔧

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:kitconcept/volto-light-theme.git
cd volto-light-theme
```

2. Install dependencies for both Backend and Frontend:

```sh
make install
```

### Fire Up the Servers 🔥

1. Start the **Backend** (Plone) at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/):

```sh
make backend-start
```

2. In a new terminal, start the **Frontend** (Volto) at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/):

```sh
make frontend-start
```

🎉 Your Plone development environment is now live!

## Trying Volto Light Theme with Docker 📦

This setup includes:

- **Prebuilt Docker images** for Backend and Frontend 🖼️
- **A complete stack** with a Traefik router and a Postgres database 🗃️
- **Accessible at** [http://voltolighttheme.localhost](http://voltolighttheme.localhost) 🌐

To start the Docker-based environment, without cloning this repository, follow these steps:

### Download docker-compose.yml

On your computer, create a new folder and download the current `docker-compose.yml`:

```sh
mkdir try-vlt
cd try-vlt
curl -L -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitconcept/volto-light-theme/refs/heads/monorepo/docker-compose.yml
```

Then start the stack using:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Once the backend image is running, create a Plone site with:

```sh
docker compose exec backend './docker-entrypoint.sh create-site'
```

🚀 Your Plone site is now up and running locally!
