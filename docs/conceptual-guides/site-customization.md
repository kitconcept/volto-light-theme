# Site customization

VLT supports site customization via the add-on `kitconcept.voltolighttheme`.
This add-on has behaviors that can be applied to any content type.
These behaviors provide fields that allow you to customize the properties and the look and feel of the site.

In Volto, content types also work as a directory in a file system tree where they can contain additional content types.
In VLT, through the use of the `@inherit` endpoint, children inherit the behaviors from `kitconcept.voltolighttheme` from the closest ancestor.

## Plone site root

Every Plone site has a site root.
Content types inherit the behaviors from this single parent.

## Subsites

Subsites are typically child content types within a Plone Site.
They usually implement {term}`INavigationRoot` behavior.
Language root folders (LRF), such as `/en` or `/ca`, are subsites.
You can create a content type that implements `INavigationRoot`, adding it anywhere in your site tree, and it will work as a subsite.

Subsites can be _nested_, so the settings that are applied are always the ones from the nearest site ancestor to the current content object.

For example, given this structure:

```console
Plone site (/)
└── LRF (/en)
    ├── Document (/en/document1)
    └── Subsite (/en/subsite)
        └── Document (/en/subsite/document2)
```

If `/en` has a custom logo, then `/en/document1` will inherit and show the logo from `/en` because it's `/en/document1`'s nearest site ancestor.

Similarly, if the subsite `/en/subsite` has set a different logo, then `/en/subsite/document2` will show the logo from `/en/subsite` instead of the one set in `/en`.

This lets you create several levels of customizations inside your Plone site.

## Add behaviors

The behaviors are named:

-   `voltolighttheme.header`
-   `voltolighttheme.theme`
-   `voltolighttheme.footer`

These behaviors enable fields for customizing the site in the assigned content type.
You should assign them to the content type that you want to customize.

To add them to a Plone site, add the following snippet to {file}`<your_backend_addon>/profiles/default/types/Plone_Site.xml`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<object xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n"
        meta_type="Dexterity FTI"
        name="Plone Site"
        i18n:domain="plone"
>
  <property name="behaviors"
            purge="false"
  >
    <element value="voltolighttheme.header" />
    <element value="voltolighttheme.theme" />
    <element value="voltolighttheme.footer" />
  </property>
</object>
```

In case you want to add them at the very top of your content type form, you will have to redefine all the current behaviors.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<object xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n"
        meta_type="Dexterity FTI"
        name="Plone Site"
        i18n:domain="plone"
>
  <property name="behaviors"
            purge="true"
  >
    <element value="voltolighttheme.header" />
    <element value="voltolighttheme.theme" />
    <element value="voltolighttheme.footer" />
    <element value="plone.dublincore" />
    <element value="plone.relateditems" />
    <element value="plone.locking" />
    <element value="plone.allowdiscussion" />
    <element value="plone.excludefromnavigation" />
    <element value="plone.tableofcontents" />
    <element value="volto.blocks" />
  </property>
</object>
```

```{note}
This is shown as a reference, and will remove any other behavior that you might have customized in your content type (Plone Site) due to the `purge="true"` directive.
You have the option of doing it either programmatically or via ZMI (`portal_types/Plone Site`) in case you want to reorder them manually.
```
