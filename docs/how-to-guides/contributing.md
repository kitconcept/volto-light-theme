# Contributing

This add-on is developed in isolation, using a Cookieplone based setup, the latest `mrs-developer`, and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18, but it does not mean that the add-on will only work in 18.


## Development requirements

-   Volto 18
-   pnpm as package manager


## Make convenience commands

Run `make help` to list the available commands.

## Development environment setup

Install package requirements with the following commands.

```shell
make install
```

### Start developing

In one terminal session, start the backend server.

```shell
make start-backend-docker
```

In a second terminal session, start the frontend server.

```shell
make start
```


## Lint

To lint the code—that is, to preview formatting suggestions of the code through ESlint, Prettier, and Stylelint—use the following command.

```shell
make lint
```


## Format

To format the code—that is, actually rewrite it through ESlint, Prettier, and Stylelint—use the following command.

```shell
make format
```


## i18n

Extract the i18n messages to locales.

```shell
make i18n
```


## Unit tests

Run unit tests.

```shell
make test
```


## Run Cypress tests


In one terminal session, start the frontend server in dev mode.

```shell
make acceptance-frontend-dev-start
```

In a second terminal session, start the backend acceptance server.

```shell
make acceptance-backend-start
```

In a third terminal session, start the Cypress interactive test runner.

```shell
make acceptance-test
```
