## Vision

The main vision of the Volto Light Theme (VLT) is to serve as a foundation for kitconcept's future projects, following the release of Plone 6.
It incorporates feedback from the company's clients and Plone community from the last few years of projects and the success stories in the UI/UX side.
It aims to be future-proof, keeping it aligned with the upcoming Volto and Plone 7 vision in terms of theming strategy decided by the Plone community.
