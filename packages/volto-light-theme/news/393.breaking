Updated the MobileNavigation component to be more easily customizable.
The component can now handle infinite navigation depth instead of only three levels, if configured to do so.
The Burger Menu can now be easily customized by overriding the new MobileNavigationToggler.jsx file.

Breaking:
- The "hamburger" icon in the mobile navigation now has an additional wrapper that allows for better customization.

If you have overriden the hamburger icon, you should make sure that your customizations still work and adjust otherwise.
