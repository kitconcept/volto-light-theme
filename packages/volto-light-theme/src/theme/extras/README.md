# Extras folder

We only keep this as compatibility and entry point for Semantic UI theme customizations.

`custom.overrides` is the Semantic UI entry point.
`custom.less` points to the `main.less` file in the root.

We will avoid to add any Semantic UI customization, except variables, which will be pointing to the main `variables.less` file in the root (see `globals/site.variables`).
