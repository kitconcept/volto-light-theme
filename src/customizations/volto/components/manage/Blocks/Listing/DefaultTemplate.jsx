/**
 * OVERRIDE DefaultTemplate.jsx
 * REASON: This was going to be removed when
 * https://github.com/plone/volto/pull/4848 was merged.
 * However, as per decission of the Volto Team, the team
 * will explore changing the headings inside a listing to a
 * better semantically structure, using no headings at all.
 * So, decission by VÃ­ctor (19/07/2023) to freeze this for now in the theme
 * still using h2 and change it (if appropiate) when the change is made.
 * To override it, override the @kitconcept/volto-light-theme one instead of
 * this one.
